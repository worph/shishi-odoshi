## **Overview**

Shishi Odoshi is a PC Screen Motion Alert Tool is designed to emit an auditory alert when there's no motion detected on the PC screen.

## **Why Use This Tool?**

- **Stay Focused**: A common distraction for many is turning to their smartphones, especially during wait times such as when a program is loading. Before we know it, we're engrossed in Social Media, Facebook, TikTok, and more. This tool serves as an audible reminder to bring your attention back to the task at hand.

- **Efficiency**: Instead of missing the completion of a loading bar or any other process due to distractions, users get an instant notification, optimizing their workflow.

## **Inspiration**

The concept behind this tool draws from a beautiful and practical feature found in traditional Japanese gardens: the **shishi odoshi** or "deer scarer." While it's primarily used to deter animals, the shishi odoshi's rhythmic knocking sound has become emblematic of peace and tranquility in gardens. Much like how the shishi odoshi grounds a person in the present by its periodic sound, the PC Screen Motion Alert Tool nudges users back to their primary task.
